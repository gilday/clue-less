To help the group track progress, the branching of this repository will be organized according to a [successful Git brancing strategy](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Other than the *master* and *development* branch, branches will be prefixed with one of 

* hotfix--
* feature--
* release--

These suffixes will help the group quickly determine the context of project changes. The master branch will contain a history of all deliverables sent to the professor.
