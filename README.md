To help the team quickly identify the context of project changes, the team will follow [a successful git branching strategy](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Other than the *master* and *development* branch, branches will be prefixed with 

* hotfix--

* feature--

* release--

Deliverables submitted to the professor will be tracked on the *master* branch


Documentation
----------

Whenever possible, documentation should be done in the semi-structured Markdown syntax. This plaintext format is compatible on all the systems the partners will use to develop the project. The team can use [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html) to convert these Markdown docs to something fancier looking for submission.
