## Quality Assurance ##

The team will focus its code quality efforts on maintainability, loose coupling, and testability. 

Testability is important since the same characteristics that make code amenable to unit testing are the characteristics of maintainable, loosely coupled code that follows the single responsibility principle. In order to encourage quality code, "The Butler Did It" will follow Test Driven Development practices when reasonable. The automated tests will help the team verify that the application meets its requirements.

Despite our automated testing efforts, software bugs will emerge in development. When a bug surfaces, the team will use Github.com's Issues feature to document the bug, explain how to reproduce it, and associate the source code commit with the fix that closes the issue. 

The team will conform to an industry best practice code format style. In order to help the team conform to the chosen style, the project will include instructions for applying this style in popular integrated development environments so that the developer tools may assist in formatting code.
