## Team Biographies ##

*	Tim Yeh
	I graduated from The University of Michigan back in 2011 with a degree in electrical engineering. 
	I currently live in Washington and work at Microsoft. After working at Microsoft for a year, I discovered pursuing an additional degree in which a majority of my peers majored in would be very beneficial. 
	I want to take what I learn and work better with those around me and advance my understanding of the overall nature of software design.

*	Mike Murawsky
	I currently live in Newark, DE, but I'm originally from the Long Beach Island Area in The Great Garden State of New Jersey. 
	Here I received a A.S in Computer Science from Ocean County College in Tom's River in '08, and a B.S. in Computer Science from The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in Pomona in '10. 
	I started working for CERDEC of the US Army in November 2010 at Fort Monmouth, until they closed and relocated the base to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 
	Since I started, and especially after the move in April 	of 2011, I've had the great pleasure of working with some of the brightest people in the engineering field.

*	Johnathan Gilday
	I'm a software developer living in Baltimore. 
	I moved here with my girlfriend Katy after finishing my undergraduate degree at Rutgers University. 
	I work for the US Army's CERDEC at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD. 
	My responsibilities include developing prototype command and control tactical applications for soldiers. 
	I enjoy building things in software and enjoy dabbling in technologies I find interesting but don't have a chance to use at work. 
	I also enjoy making things in the kitchen and have been trying to hone my culinary skills on the weekends.
	
## Team Roles ##

**Lead Architect: Mike Murawsky**
	As the Lead Architect I shall determine and propose to the team what core functionality needs to be fulfilled and what supporting components need to built off that framework.  I will help insure that the core and supporting elements will be broken down into their most elemental state as to ensure out software is completely modular with out losing sight of goal of the requirements.

**Configuration Manager: Johnathan Gilday**
	As Configuration Manager, I will ensure that all team members are able to access version controlled documentation and source code for the entire project. I will establish a format for the documentation that is compatible with the mixed set of software tools available to the team. The team will also use an organized branching strategy to establish a traceable pattern for the project's evolution. I will establish a common build environment for the project source code to limit problems in the "it works on my machine" category.
